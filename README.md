# Meta Frontend Developer Course üìñ‚úèÔ∏è
This repository is my collection of codes and notes I've written while taking these courses offered by Meta. 

[Meta Frontend Developer Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) offers a 9 course series taught by the Meta Staff which includes the following courses:  
1. [Introduction to Frontend Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-front-end-development?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)  
2. [Programming with Javascript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)  
3. [Version Control](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-version-control?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)  
4. [HTML & CSS In-depth](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)     
5. [React Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)   
6. [Advanced React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)   
7. [Principles of UX/UI Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-ux-ui-design?specialization=meta-front-end-developer)
